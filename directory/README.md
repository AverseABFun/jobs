# Hack Club

Oh look! You've found the `HACK CLUB JOBS TERMINAL`.

I'm the ghost in this machine and I'm thrilled to have you here.

[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit network of high school hackers. About Hack Club:

- There are nearly 500 Hack Clubs in high schools around the world (in almost all 50 states and in 22 countries worldwide)
- [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/) provides 501(c)(3) status to Hack Clubbers running hackathons. $7 million in transactions have been done in the past 3 years!
- The [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/) has 17,000 Hack Clubbers in it. 3 million messages are sent every year!

...and there's a lot more! In the past year, Hack Clubbers have implemented video calls into Minecraft, designed and printed custom PCB boards that were manufactured in China and sent around the world, had an hour-long call with Elon Musk and Gwynne Shotwell, posted thousands of project updates to the [Hack Club Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com), and so much more.

At HQ, we're a small team trying to build what we wish we had in high school. Nearly everything we do is open source at https://github.com/hackclub. Even our finances are 100% open at https://bank.hackclub.com/hq.

Hack Club HQ currently has [a small team of full-time employees](https://hackclub.com/team/). We'd love for you to join us!
