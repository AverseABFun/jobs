# Events Designer @ Hack Club

Hack Club is where 16,000+ teenage programmers talk, build, and have fun together. We do crazy things like hosting AMAs with Elon Musk and running the world's longest hackathon on a train.

We're looking for someone **fun, creative, and technical** to excite and grow the community.

### Couple things about you

- You're passionate about building technical projects and find tinkering fun
- You've worked with teenagers and are excited to work 1:1 with them every day
- You have event planning or media production experience and want to apply it

### Projects you'll lead on

- Produce and project manage the big, crazy things we do every few months
- Support Hack Clubbers in creating and executing their awesome ideas
- Revive Hack Night, our weekly casual technical hangout with the community
- Lead on organizing AMAs and conversations with famous tech leaders
- Game design events at Hack Club to better help students form meaningful relationships

### Location

We have a strong preference for someone in-person in Burlington, VT, but we will consider applications from people who want to work remotely, provided they are willing to travel to our offices.

We have COVID protocols and take them seriously. Relocation assistance available.

### Compensation

This role pays between $60K - $100K, depending on your experienceâ€” and we know that's probably less than you'd make elsewhere. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.
